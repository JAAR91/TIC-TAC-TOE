 squares by 3 squares as described in the image below
                                +-----+-----+-----+
                                |  1  |  2  |  3  |
                                +-----+-----+-----+
                                |  4  |  5  |  6  |
                                +-----+-----+-----+
                                |  7  |  8  |  9  |

You are X, your friend  is O. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, 
across, or diagonally) is the winner. You can win by having a line of  3 O/X. The lines 
can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal in both opposite directions. You can only win if 
you manage to have O or X cutting across equally either diagonally, horizonatally or 
vertically, but if  no one can complete a line of 3 O/X THEN it's a tie. When all 9 
squares are full, the game is over
